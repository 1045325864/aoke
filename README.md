GA-Based Multipopulation Synergistic Gene Screening Strategy on Critical Nodes Detection

## Just so you know, there is a slight discrepancy between this code and the paper. In the paper, when describing the pruning algorithm popEvolution, the algorithm is set to three iterations, with the population evolving thirty times at each iteration, and the gene pool deletion percentage is 20%. After three iterations, the proportion of remaining genes in the gene pool is 40%. The code uploaded here is a version for comparison, where popEvolution only performs one iteration, the population evolves 100 times, and then 60% of the genes are deleted. Compared to no_cutoff, greedy and popInitial, both evolutionary strategies lead to an improvement in the performance of the GA and are able to prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum too early on some datasets.
