GA-Based Multipopulation Synergistic Gene Screening Strategy on Critical Nodes Detection

## Please note: there is a slight discrepancy between this code and the paper. In the paper, when describing the pruning algorithm popEvolution, the algorithm is set to three iterations, with the population evolving thirty times at each iteration, and the gene pool deletion percentage is 20%. After three iterations, the proportion of remaining genes in the gene pool is 40%. The code uploaded here is a control version, where popEvolution only performs one iteration, the population evolves 100 times, and then 60% of the genes are deleted.
